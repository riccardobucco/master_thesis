Being dependent on Laplacian eigenvectors makes it difficult to transfer a learned filter to another graph

Most  of  the  transforms  forsignals  on  graphs  involve  computations  requiring  theeigenvectors  of  the  graph  Laplacian  or  the  normalizedgraph Laplacian. However, it is not practical to explicitlycompute  these  eigenvectors  for  extremely  large  graphs,as  the  computational  complexity  of  doing  so  does  notscale  gracefully  with  the  size  of  the  graph.  Thus,  animportant area of research is approximate computationaltechniques   for   signal   processing   on   graphs.   Efficientnumerical  implementations  for  certain  classes  of  graphoperators have been suggested using polynomial approx-imations

The  signal  processing  techniques  we  have  described  arefocused  on  extracting  information  from  a  static  signal  on  astatic,  weighted,  undirected  graph. considering a time-varying seriesof  underlying  graphs,???
